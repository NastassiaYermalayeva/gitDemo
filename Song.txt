Go easy on me
I was still a child didnâ€™t get the chance to
See the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do

So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
